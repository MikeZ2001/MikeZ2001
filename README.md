<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Michele Zurlo</h1>

# About me
I am a passionate computer science student at the University of Naples Federico II and I am currently enrolled in the Apple Developer Academy program.

Computer science faculty allowed me to learn algorithms, data structures, DBMS, web technologies, software engineering, C, and Java language. Apple Developer Academy experience allowed me to practice what I learned at the university and also to learn new things such as UI/UX Design principles, how to manage my time, work with different teams, how to adapt to different situations, develop apps in Swift Language and solve real-life problems. I try always to do my best and learn as much as possible.

## Five Dots - iOS App
Five Dots is an iOS app, designed to support users become more self-aware by allowing them to record their daily thoughts and feelings, in the form of a card. Users can also view their entries through a calendar feature, which displays the card for each day.

The app is being developed following the CBL process with my team composed of 2 developers, 2 designers, and 1 Team Lead. I was one of the developers of the team and I also followed the design process. We started with a desk research about mental well-being and then with our app, we found a way to support people to become more self-aware.

## Veggie's Attack - iOS App
Veggieâ€™s Attack is an iOS (and soon IPadOS app) endless space shooter in which a bald man must destroy all the veggies trying to kill him.

The app is being developed with my team composed of 3 developers, and 1 designer. I was one of the developers of the team and I also followed the design process. We asked ourselves, how to make a fun game and so with our creativity,  we created our product.

## Neutone - iOS App

Neutone is an app designed specifically for makeup artists and anyone looking to find the perfect foundation match for their skin undertone. This app uses a machine learning model to accurately detect the skin undertone. With Neutone, users can take a simple photo and receive as a result their skin undertone. This eliminates the guesswork and frustration often associated with finding the perfect shade of makeup, saving time and money in the process. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned makeup artist or a beauty enthusiast, Neutone is the right tool for you.

The app is being developed following the CBL process with my team composed of 3 developers, 1 designer, and 1 project manager. I was one of the developers of the team and I also followed the design process. At the beginning of the project, we knew 0 about the topic, which helped us have no bias. We started with a desk research to learn more about the topic and then interviewed and directly observed make-up artists while they were doing their job. From our research, we found out that their main struggle was to find the skin undertone of their client. So with our product, we want to support make-up enthusiasts and makeup artist to find their skin undertone with simple steps.

## MindLoop - iOS and IPadOS App

MindLoop is an innovative application that helps you stimulate your creativity and generate brilliant ideas through the process of brainstorming. With MindLoop, you can free your mind and capture all your ideas on virtual cards, creating a continuous flow of thoughts and concepts without limits.

The app is being developed following the CBL process with my team of 3 developers, 2 designers, and 1 project manager. I was one of the developers of the team and I also followed the design process.

Everything comes from our needs, we were stuck in finding an idea for the app, so we asked ourselves, why we donâ€™t make an app that supports brainstorming. We wanted to make something new, so we started creating our own way to do brainstorming and then we tested it with different focus groups. Testing the technique with the group let us understand that there was a problem during brainstorming sessions, people followed the strongest personality of the group (this means that the ideas of other people were not considered) and that having a time constraint helps people to be creative.
So we introduced in our app anonymity,  a timer for each phase of brainstorming, and a new way to do brainstorming which consists of 4 simple steps: 
- Choose your topic
- Write max 10 words linked to that topic
- Write 2 ideas linked to that topic and words
- Blend the two ideas into a third idea.

If you are happy with your result, you can share your card however you prefer or restart the session.

## Ratatouille 23 - University project - Android Mobile and Java Desktop App

Ratatouille23 is a system aimed at supporting the management and operation of restaurant businesses. The system consists of a performant and reliable application through which users can enjoy the system's functionality in an intuitive, quick and pleasant way.

These are the requests from the stakeholders: 
- An administrator can create user accounts for their employees (both dining room staff, kitchen staff, and supervisors). Upon first login, each user must reset the password provided by the administrator and choose a different password.
- An administrator (or a supervisor) can customize the restaurant's menu. Specifically, the user can create and/or delete items from the menu. Each item is characterized by a name, a cost, a description, and a list of common allergens. Furthermore, it is possible to organize menu items into customizable categories (e.g., first courses, desserts, seafood dishes, beverages, etc.) and define the order in which the items appear on the menu. During data entry, autocomplete is required for certain products (e.g., beverages or prepackaged items) using open data such as those available at https://it.openfoodfacts.org/data.
- A waiter can record orders by indicating the table number and the desired menu items.
- A kitchen staff member can view orders in real-time, proceed with preparing the dishes, and keep track of fulfilled orders.
- A supervisor can view the bill for each table in a PDF format at any given moment. Additionally, when customers sitting at a particular table leave, the supervisor can close the bill and view the final version to present to the customer.
- An administrator can view detailed statistics on the productivity of the kitchen staff. In particular, within a customizable time frame, it should be possible to view at least the number of orders each kitchen staff member has fulfilled. The presence of interactive graphs is appreciated.

In particular, the functionalities reserved for waiter and kitchen staff will be accessed on tablets, while the functionalities intended for administrators and supervisors will primarily be accessed through notebooks or PCs. Since the hardware (tablets and notebooks) has not been purchased yet, it can be assumed that both devices have an operating system of the contractors' choice (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.).
