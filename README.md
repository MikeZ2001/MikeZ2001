<p align="left">
I am a passionate computer science student at the University of Naples Federico II and I am currently enrolled in the Apple Developer Academy program.
The faculty of computer science gave me the opportunity to learn algorithms, data structures, DBMS, web technologies, software engineering, C, and Java language. 
Apple Developer Academy experience gave me the opportunity to practice what I learned at the university and also to learn new things such as UI/UX Design principles, how to manage my time, work with different teams, how to adapt to different situations, develop apps in Swift Language and solve real-life problems. I try always to do my best and learn as much as possible.

This app uses a machine learning model to accurately detect the skin undertone.With Neutone, users can take a simple photo and receive as result their skin undertone.

The app is being developed following the CBL process with my team composed by 3 developers , 1 designer and 1 project manager. I was one of the developer of the team and I also followed the design process. At the beginning of the project we knew 0 about the topic and this helped us to have no bias. We started from a desk research to know more about the topic and then we interviewed and direct observed make-up artist while they were doing their job. From our research we found out that their main struggle was to find the skin undertone of their client. So with our product we we want to support make-up enthusiasts and make up artist to find their skin undertone with simple steps.

- Hold meetings physically in meeting rooms or telematically on a video conferencing platform.
- Keep track of project and meeting attendance for the purpose of individual participant evaluation.
- Select participants based on research criteria such as the participant's average salary and company rating, as well as the type of projects he or she took part in.

## Ratatouille 23 - University project - Android Mobile and Java Desktop App

Ratatouille23 is a system aimed at supporting the management and operation of restaurant businesses. The system consists of a performant and reliable application through which users can enjoy the system's functionality in an intuitive, quick and pleasant way.

These are the requests from the stakeholders: 
- An administrator can create user accounts for their employees (both dining room staff, kitchen staff, and supervisors). Upon first login, each user must reset the password provided by the administrator and choose a different password.
- An administrator (or a supervisor) can customize the restaurant's menu. Specifically, the user can create and/or delete items from the menu. Each item is characterized by a name, a cost, a description, and a list of common allergens. Furthermore, it is possible to organize menu items into customizable categories (e.g., first courses, desserts, seafood dishes, beverages, etc.) and define the order in which the items appear on the menu. During data entry, autocomplete is required for certain products (e.g., beverages or prepackaged items) using open data such as those available at https://it.openfoodfacts.org/data.
- A waiter can record orders by indicating the table number and the desired menu items.
- A kitchen staff member can view orders in real-time, proceed with preparing the dishes, and keep track of fulfilled orders.
- A supervisor can view the bill for each table in a PDF format at any given moment. Additionally, when customers sitting at a particular table leave, the supervisor can close the bill and view the final version to present to the customer.
- An administrator can view detailed statistics on the productivity of the kitchen staff. In particular, within a customizable time frame, it should be possible to view at least the number of orders each kitchen staff member has fulfilled. The presence of interactive graphs is appreciated.

In particular, the functionalities reserved for waiter and kitchen staff will be accessed on tablets, while the functionalities intended for administrators and supervisors will primarily be accessed through notebooks or PCs. Since the hardware (tablets and notebooks) has not been purchased yet, it can be assumed that both devices have an operating system of the contractors' choice (e.g., Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.).
